# Face Detection using OpenCV 🎭

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **real-time face detection** using OpenCV and a **pre-trained Haar cascade classifier**. It captures frames from a webcam, detects faces, and highlights them with a green rectangle.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face detection from a webcam.
- Uses **Haar Cascade Classifier** for face recognition.
- Simple and efficient with OpenCV.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.7)
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- A working webcam

## For Exiting
Using 'Esc' key (ASCII 27) to exit or close the webcam.
